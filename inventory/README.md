# Crypto Inventory – PQC Readiness

This folder demonstrates the ** first and most critical step ** in any Post‑Quantum Cryptography (PQC) migration:

 > ** Identifying where quantum‑vulnerable cryptography is used today. **

The goal is *visibility*, not replacement.

## What this demo does

The program `crypto_inventory_demo.py`:

* Establishes a real TLS connection to a target endpoint
* Observes negotiated TLS parameters
* Extracts available certificate metadata
* Classifies cryptographic usage from a **quantum‑risk perspective**

This mirrors how early‑stage PQC discovery tools work in enterprise environments.

---

## TLS version discovery

The TLS version (e.g., TLS 1.2 vs TLS 1.3) is **not hard‑coded**.

Instead:

* Python’s 'ssl' module delegates protocol support to the underlying **OpenSSL** library
* During the TLS handshake, the server selects the highest mutually supported version
* The program reports the negotiated result

This reflects real‑world behavior: identical code may negotiate different TLS versions on different systems depending on OpenSSL and OS policy.

## Why the certificate signature algorithm may appear as 'None'

You may observe output such as:

```
[Certificate Signature Algorithm]: None
Classification: Unknown
```

This is **expected behavior**, especially for TLS 1.3 connections.

### Explanation

* The server certificate *does* contain a signature algorithm (e.g., RSA or ECDSA)
* However, Python’s 'ssl.getpeercert()' API exposes only a **limited, sanitized view** of the X.509 certificate
* In TLS 1.3, the certificate signature algorithm is often **not surfaced** through this API

This is an **API visibility limitation**, not a cryptographic absence.

---

## TLS 1.3 nuance

TLS 1.3 distinguishes between:

1. **Certificate signature algorithm** (X.509)
2. **Handshake signature algorithm** (used during key exchange)

Python’s standard 'ssl' interface does not reliably expose either for inspection.

Real inventory tools address this by:

* Parsing certificates directly (ASN.1)
* Using specialized libraries (e.g., 'cryptography')
* Integrating OpenSSL tooling

---

## Why this limitation is important for PQC readiness

This demo intentionally highlights that:

* Cryptographic inventory is **non‑trivial**
* Visibility gaps exist even in modern APIs
* PQC migration requires tooling, not assumptions

Recognizing and documenting these gaps is a core part of responsible PQC planning.

---

## Scope of this demo

This folder focuses on:

* Discovery
* Classification
* Risk labeling

It intentionally does **not**:

* Implement PQC algorithms
* Replace cryptographic primitives
* Perform cryptanalysis

Those belong to later migration phases.

---

## Next steps

Possible extensions include:

* Explicit certificate parsing using 'cryptography.x509'
* Multi‑endpoint scanning
* Inventory report aggregation

These will be added incrementally as the repository evolves.
